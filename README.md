# Molecules_Solubility
Here we try to predict the Aqueous Solubility of Chemical Molecules (Drugs)
We use a dataset composed of 1145 molecules with their solubility values and their SMILES representation
We use following descriptors Octanol water partition, Molecular Weight, Number of Rotable Bonds, Aromatic Proportion
We use rdkit module to generate the descriptors
